  ### What is python?
   - Interpreted, interacted, object-oriented programming language
   - Interepreted tool for verifying the correct syntax.
   - Interact with different tools 
   - Object-oriented to create data and perform actions using methods.

  ## Python Comparison to other programming languages -44% used
  1. JS,HTML, CSS -web dev
  2. SQL - Standard query language
  3. Python doesn't run on the server.
  4. Java is theking of backend/ applications development
  5. C is the backbone of C programming
   -Abstraction: hiding the details of implementation, python acts like it.C is a low-level programming language 
   - C is used to process the python as a computer 'read'

   ### Examples of python in the workplace
   1. Business statistics
   2. Business analytics
   3. Machine learning and AI
   4. Office assistance - sort, manage, web scrapping, email and read large sources of data from a computer.


   ## Python Data Types
   1. Strings
   - Information has to be stored in a data type python understands.
   - type('') for checking data type

   - Str is used for the string rep. Its written using double or single quotes
   `<class 'str'>`
   	- `"Chase".upper()`

   2. Integers
    - No commas or spaces for big numbers to avoid split reading.
    `<class 'int'`
    - You can convert a str number into an integer by using `int('2')`
   3. Floats
    - Numeric data type, a decimal
    - Float doesn't have many methods. `random_float.as_integer_ratio()` is one of them.
    - No quotation marks are used to write it down.
    - When using conversion, the float is always rounded down

   4. Boolean values
   - Syntax: 1(Truth) and 0(False)
   - Any basic data type can be tested for truth value
   - TRUE and FALSE and is rep by bool
   - Truthy: Statements/values that evaluate to True:1
   - Falsy: Statements or values that result to false:0
   - True/False needs to have T and F capitlized otherwise they are not recognized.
   - If the values/statements are put within quotations, they stop being boolean
   - Dynamic typing: The data type for a vaue in Python can be changed after t is created. *This is not true for all programming languages.*
