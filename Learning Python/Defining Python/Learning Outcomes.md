  ### What is python?
   - Interpreted, interacted, object-oriented programming language
   - Interepreted tool for verifying the correct syntax.
   - Interact with different tools 
   - Object-oriented to create data and perform actions using methods.

  ## Python Comparison to other programming languages -44% used
  1. JS,HTML, CSS -web dev
  2. SQL - Standard query language
  3. Python doesn't run on the server.
  4. Java is theking of backend/ applications development
  5. C is the backbone of C programming
   -Abstraction: hiding the details of implementation, python acts like it.C is a low-level programming language 
   - C is used to process the python as a computer 'read'

   ### Examples of python in the workplace
   1. Business statistics
   2. Business analytics
   3. Machine learning and AI
   4. Office assistance - sort, manage, web scrapping, email and read large sources of data from a computer.


   ## Python Data Types
   1. Strings
   - Valid strings use quotation marks
   - Information has to be stored in a data type python understands.
   - type('') for checking data type

   - Str is used for the string rep. Its written using double or single quotes
   `<class 'str'>`
   	- `"Chase".upper()`

   2. Integers
    - No commas or spaces for big numbers to avoid split reading.
    `<class 'int'`
    - You can convert a str number into an integer by using `int('2')`
   3. Floats
    - Numeric data type, a decimal
    - Float doesn't have many methods. `random_float.as_integer_ratio()` is one of them.
    - No quotation marks are used to write it down.
    - When using conversion, the float is always rounded down

   4. Boolean values
   - Syntax: 1(Truth) and 0(False)
   - Any basic data type can be tested for truth value
   - TRUE and FALSE and is rep by bool
   - Truthy: Statements/values that evaluate to True:1
   - Falsy: Statements or values that result to false:0
   - True/False needs to have T and F capitlized otherwise they are not recognized.
   - If the values/statements are put within quotations, they stop being boolean
   - Dynamic typing: The data type for a vaue in Python can be changed after t is created. *This is not true for all programming languages.*


 # Lesson Summary - Python and IT Overview  

## IT Work and Career Roles  
1. A complete dedication to IT work is needed for **System Administrators & IT Assistants**.  
2. Limited technology literacy is required for **Specialized Machine Technicians & Sales**.  
3. An overlap between the two includes roles in **Marketing, Accounting, Quality Assurance, and Managerial Positions**.  

## Introduction to Python  
- **Python**, a code that is read more often than it is written, was created by _Guido van Rossum_.  
- It is an *open-source (OSI) programming language* that is **friendly and easy to learn**.  

## Core Characteristics of Python  
Python is known for three main characteristics:  
1. **Interpreted** – A tool to understand the instructions you are giving it.  
2. **Interactive** – Easy to test code.  
3. **Object-Oriented** – Enables creating objects to store data and perform actions.  

## Developer Survey (2020) – Popular Programming Languages  
In 2020, Stack Overflow conducted a developer survey to find out which programming languages were most frequently used:  
- **JavaScript** – 67.7%  
- **HTML/CSS** – 63.1%  
- **SQL** – 54.7%  
- **Python** – 44.1%  
- **Java** – 40.2%  
- **Bash/Shell/Powershell** – 33.1%  

## Python in the Workplace  
Examples of how Python is applied in different fields:  
- **Business Statistics**  
- **Machine Learning & AI**  
- **Office Assistants**  
- **Market Research**  
- **Scientific Research**  

## Basic Data Types in Python  
Some of the data types you will learn about in this course include:  
- **Integers**  
- **Strings**  
- **Floats**  

To check a value’s data type, use the built-in function `type(value)`.  

### Strings  
- Strings can be created using **single (`' '`) or double (`" "`) quotes**, but they must match.  
- In Python, `str` represents a string value type.  
- The string object has built-in methods (e.g., `.upper()`) that perform tasks with the string value.  

### Integers  
- Integers are whole numbers.  
- **Commas are not recognized** in numbers; for example, to display `100,000` in Python, you must **omit the comma** (`100000`).  

### Floats  
- The term **float** comes from **floating-point number**, also known as a decimal.  
- When converting floats to integers, Python **always rounds down**.  

### Boolean Values  
- Boolean values are used for comparisons: **`True`** and **`False`**.  
- Any object can be tested for truth value, known as **truthy** and **falsy** values.  
- The integer value of `True` is `1`, while `False` returns `0`.  

## Using Repl.it  
- The site [Repl.it](https://repl.it) can easily be used to write and run Python code for beginners and those who have not installed Python on their local machine.  
- When signing up for Repl.it, you can use your Google, GitHub, or Facebook account instead of simply using your email address.
