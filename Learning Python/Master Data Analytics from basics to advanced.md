# Master Data Analytics from basics to advanced
 
 All system functions in python lowercase e.g int, len

 1. Python is a scripting language as opposed to JAVA which is a compiled language. This explains the slow process.

 ## Basic Arithmetics
	  - Eg. 10 + 2 = 12 (No need to define the variables like in JAVA)
	  - Modulus calculates the remainder of a division calculation
	  e.g. _15 % 4 is 3_
	  - x = 10
   ### Creating/Declaring Variables
     ```
   		x = 10
		y = 12
		```
	### Calling/Running a Variable
		```x + y;```
		12
	### BASIC DATA TYPES
		1. Integers _e.g 5, 10_
		2. Floats _e.g 10.0, 2.0_
		3. String _e.g '10', "10"_
		4. Boolean _e.g True, False_
	To check for the type of data, type(2.0) and it will give you an answer like 
	```python
	x = 10.2
		type(x)
	```
	### CONTAINER DATA TYPES
	1. Lists _e.g Fruits = ["Apple", "Oranges"]_
	- How to check the first item of the list. e.g Fruits[0], last_item=Fruits[-1], first_two=Fruits[:2]
	- How to check the length of the list. e.g len(Fruits)
	- Use ratio to bring up the list of items according to the order

	### Special Types Of Lists
	1. **Tuples** - Similar to the common lists but instead of squared brackets, use parenthesis because they do not support modification.
	2. **Sets** - Lists with curly braces. Important when repeated items are detected get automatically removed.
