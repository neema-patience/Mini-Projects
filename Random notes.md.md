## Including code in md file
- In a Markdown (.md) file, you can include code using backticks (). There are two main ways to format code:
1. Inline Code
Use single backticks (`) to include short snippets of code within a sentence.

- Use the `console.log()` function to print output in JavaScript.
2. Code Blocks
- For longer code snippets, use triple backticks (```) and specify the language (e.g., js, python, html) for syntax highlighting.
 ```js
	function greet(name) {
		return `Hello, ${name}!`;
	}
	console.log(greet("Neema"));

### 3. **Indented Code Blocks**  
Alternatively, you can indent lines with **four spaces** or **one tab**, but this method doesnâ€™t support syntax highlighting.

```md
    function greet(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    console.log(greet("Neema"));
### Setting path for a file
