# Suggestions to Improve the Palindrome Checker Application

1. **Input Normalization**:
   - Update the `check()` function to normalize the input by removing spaces and punctuation, and converting it to lowercase.

2. **History Table**:
   - Implement a table to keep track of previously checked words and their results in the first row. History should be beneath the checked word

3. **Styling Enhancements**:
   - Ensure that the result display area and history table are styled appropriately for better visibility and user experience.


6. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Ensure a word cannot be repeated if it is in the history record. Instead, highlight the word. 


8. **Testing**:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that the user interface is user-friendly.
