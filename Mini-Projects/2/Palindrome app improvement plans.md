# Suggestions to Improve the Palindrome Checker Application

1. **Input Normalization**:
   - Update the `check()` function to normalize the input by removing spaces and punctuation.

2. **History Table**:
   - Implement a table to keep track of previously checked words and their results in the first row. History should be beneath the checked word

3. **Styling Enhancements**:
   - Ensure that the result display area and history table are styled appropriately for better visibility and user experience.
   - Create a header for the title and adjust for space between the text field and the table


4. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Ensure a word cannot be repeated in the history record, highlight the word in the history table instead. 


5. **Testing**:
   - Test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that the user interface is user-friendly.
