# Plan for Enhancing Color Flipper

## Plan:
1. **Color History**:
   - Implement an array to store the last few colors used.
   - Add a button to revert to the last color used.

2. **Color Palette**:
   - Integrate a color picker input element to allow users to select any color.
   - Update the background color based on the selected color from the color picker.

3. **Animation Effects**:
   - Add CSS transitions to the body element for a smooth color change effect.

4. **Text Color Change**:
   - Implement logic to change the text color based on the background color to ensure readability.

5. **Save Favorite Colors**:
   - Create a section to display favorite colors and allow users to save their preferred colors for quick access.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the above features in the `main.html` and `index.js` files.
- Test the functionality to ensure all features work as expected.
