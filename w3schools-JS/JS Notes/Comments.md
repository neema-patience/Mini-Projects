- JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

- JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

## Single Line Comments
- Single line comments start with //.

- Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

## Multi-line Comments
- Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

- Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

### Using Comments to Prevent Execution
- Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

- Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.
