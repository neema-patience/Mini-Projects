### JavaScript statements are composed of:

 - Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

 - The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

#### Semicolons ;
 - Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

 - Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement. When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed.

#### JavaScript White Space
 - JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

#### JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
 - For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

 - If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator.

### JavaScript Code Blocks
 - JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

 - The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

 - One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions.

## JavaScript Keywords
 - JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
 - JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
