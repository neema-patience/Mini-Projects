/*External JavaScript Advantages

--Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

1. It separates HTML and code
2. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
3. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

External References

-- An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

1. With a full URL (a full web address)
2. With a file path (like /js/)
3. Without any path
